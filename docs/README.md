# Google Docs Lite

A simple document app that updates the document in real time when someone is typing.

# Installation

This assumes you have ruby installed on your system

* Clone the repo

* cd into the docs-frontend directory. Run the front-end using:

        yarn start
      

* cd into the docs backend. Run the backend/API with 

        rails s -p 3001
        
* Run `localhost:3000` in your browser. Open another browser window and load `localhost:3000` in it. Put them side by side and start editing the note. :D
